# analog-clock
Simple analog and digital clock

*Uses CSS keyframes animation and JavaScript to change animation rules*

**Analog clock shows current time on a clock-face**
- receives current time only once when loaded
- converts time's values into degrees
- rotates clock hands to the position of found degrees
- changes default CSS 'keyframe' rule (starting and end position of clock hands)
- uses 'keyframes' animation to change clock hands position every second

**Digital clock shows time in 24-hour notation (hh:mm:ss)**
- receives current time every second
- adds zero before one digit time's value
- displays on the page
